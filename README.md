# Case_Decks
I am a passionate problem solver who thrives on tackling complex challenges, particularly through case competitions. These competitions provide me with the opportunity to apply my analytical skills, develop innovative solutions, and deliver measurable results. I enjoy leveraging my expertise in technology, entrepreneurship, and policy to craft impactful strategies and address real-world problems.

**Problem Statement:**
Students are consuming more foods high in energy, fats, free sugars and salt/sodium, and do not eat enough fruit, vegetables and other dietary fibre. Most
