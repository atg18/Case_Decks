I am a passionate problem solver who thrives on tackling complex challenges, particularly through case competitions. These competitions provide me with the opportunity to apply my analytical skills, develop innovative solutions, and deliver measurable results. I enjoy leveraging my expertise in technology, entrepreneurship, and policy to craft impactful strategies and address real-world problems.
